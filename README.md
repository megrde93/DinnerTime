Hello! This project was created as part of my Ironhack bootcamp curriculum.
If you never know what to make for dinner, this web app is for you!
It asks a set list of questions, and then randomly selects a list of ingredients to make for your meal. But wait! It can also take those ingredients and send them to an API to get a list of suggested recipes for you!
